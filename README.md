# DBSCAN-Driving

## Motivation
We argue that driving styles demand adaptive classifications, and such mechanisms are essential for adaptive and personalized Human-Vehicle Interaction systems. To this end, we conduct an in-depth study to demystify complicated interactions between driving behaviors and styles. 

## Introduction
Our studies start with rigorous examinations of the impacts from different DBSCAN configurations, representative driver groups, time-series variations, road conditions and etc.  After that, we make 8 key findings through our studies in total.


## Goal
Our  goal  is  to  demystify  complicated  interactions  between  driving  behaviors and driving styles, to reveal the opportunities for adaptive and personalized Human-Vehicle Interactions.  

## Procedure
1. First normalize all driving statistics based on the specific insights.
2. Then, we use Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise  (DBSCAN), for  adaptive  classifications  of  driving  styles  and  hidden patterns  of  driving  behaviors.
