# DBSCAN-Driving

## Motivation
Previous attempts, to characterize driving styles, focus on the differentiatedtrends of driving statistics (e.g. driving speeds, headway distance, following time,multi-modal information and etc.). Such studies overlook theeffects of time-series and results in coarse-grained decision-making procedures,for the determinations and classifications of driving styles. Hence, we make the key  observation  that  static  partitions  of  driving  styles/behaviors  may  not  besuitable for adaptive and personalized Driver-Vehicle Interactions. 

## Introduction
We make the followingkey contributionsin this paper:
– We  address  the  problem  that  conventional  classifications  of  driving  styles overlook the opportunities for adaptive and personalized Human-Vehicle In-teractions,  and  identify  that  the  static  partitions  of  driving  styles  are  thekey limitation in conventional approaches.
– To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose and utilize Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), for adaptiveclassifications of driving styles and hidden patterns of driving behaviors.
– We  experimentally  characterize  and  examine  the  effects  of  our  DBSCAN-based approach over BROOK, a state-of-the-art and open-sourced datasetfor Human-Vehicle Interactions.
– We retrieve 8 key findings from the above studies, by rigorously changingdifferent configurations. These observations can serve as starting guidelinesfor  adaptive  and  personalized  Human-Vehicle  Interactions  systems  in  thefuture, for both research and industrial communities.

## Goal
Our  goal  is  to  demystify  complicated  interactions  between  driving  behav-iors and driving styles, to reveal the opportunities for adaptive and personalizedHuman-Vehicle Interactions.  

## Procedure
1. First normalize all driving statistics based on the specific insights.
2. To this end, we use Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications withNoise  (DBSCAN), for  adaptive  classifications  of  driving  styles  and  hiddenpatterns  of  driving  behaviors.
